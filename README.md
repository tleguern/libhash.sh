# libhash.sh

This repository contains a series of libraries designed to perform hashing algorithm in shell script.

* md2.sh implements the obsolete MD2 hashing algorithm, described in RFC1319.
* adler32.sh implements the ADLER32 checksum algorithm, described in RFC1950.

Note: The current implementations don't handle spaces nor the empty string.

## Requirements

* any POSIX shell from the ยง Compatibility section.
